## ** Prompt Engineering & Frameworks Presentation**

### **Slide 1: Title**
- **Slide Content**: “**Prompt Engineering & Frameworks**”

“Hello everyone, and welcome to my short presentation on **Prompt Engineering** and **Prompt Frameworks**. My name is Javi, and over the next minutes, we’ll explore what prompt engineering is, why it matters, and how specific frameworks can help us get better results from AI models. We’ll also see how we can use a large language model like **Gemini** in both developer and everyday scenarios.”

---

### **Slide 2: What Is Prompt Engineering?**
- **Slide Content**: A definition of prompt engineering, plus reasons why we use prompt frameworks.

“First, let’s define **Prompt Engineering**. Essentially, it’s about creating clear, targeted instructions—known as *prompts*—for large language models. Because models like Gemini, GPT, or Llama 2 interpret our words so literally, writing a well-structured prompt can be the difference between an answer that’s vague or off-topic and one that’s accurate and actionable.  

We use **Prompt Frameworks** because they help us add clarity and consistency. They remind us to include crucial information—like the role the AI should take, the context or constraints, the style or format we want, and the purpose of our request. This makes sure we’re not leaving anything out. Plus, correclty phrasing the prompt can contribute to saving on tokens, potentially reducing costs and time.

AI companies like Google (with their Gemini models) typically charge for usage based on a pay-as-you-go model tied to the number of tokens processed.”

### **Slide 3: Popular Prompt Frameworks**
- **Slide Content**: The table comparing CRISP, RACI, SCQA, PACER, PEEL, Chain-of-Thought, HARPA, RTF, CTF, and RASCEF.

“Here we have a table of **popular prompt frameworks**, each with different strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases. Let’s go over them briefly:

1. **CRISP** focuses on context, role, input, steps, and purpose—great for detailing tech tasks.  
2. **RACI** clarifies role, audience, channel, and intent—useful for communicating to diverse audiences.  
3. **SCQA** is a story-like approach for problem-solving, framing situation → complication → question → answer.  
4. **PACER** is iterative—plan, act, clarify, evaluate, and refine—good for step-by-step coding or processes.  
5. **PEEL** is simple and emphasizes examples and linking back to the purpose.  
6. **Chain-of-Thought** helps you see the AI’s reasoning—useful for debugging or complex tasks.  
7. **HARPA** organizes your request with a hook, ask, respond, provide feedback, and answer.  
8. **RTF** stands for role, task, and format—very straightforward, perfect for quick instructions.  
9. **CTF** focuses on context, task, and format—similar to RTF, but highlights context.  
10. **RASCEF** is comprehensive—role, audience, style, context, examples, format—great for formal or multi-stakeholder tasks.

It’s important to pick the right framework for your goal. If you need something short and sweet, **RTF** is awesome. If you need to cover many details, **RASCEF** or **CRISP** might be better.”

### **Slide 4: Using Gemini**
- **Slide Content**: Explains that we’re importing Gemini and can use these frameworks for various tasks.

“Now, we’ll look at how these frameworks apply in practice. We’ll be using **Gemini**, a large language model by Google, similar to GPT. The steps I’ll show you can also apply to other LLMs since frameworks are **model-agnostic**. It’s all about writing clear prompts and letting the AI handle the rest.  

In our notebook, we have some simple Python code that imports the Gemini client—this is similar to how you might use a library for GPT, Llama, or any other LLM. Let’s see how we actually create prompts for two scenarios: one for **developers** and another for **everyday tasks**.”

### **Slide 5: Developer Scenario (CRISP)**
- **Slide Content**: The CRISP-based prompt for a Node.js app returning 500 errors.

“Here’s an example of using **CRISP** in a developer scenario. Suppose we have a Node.js application throwing 500 errors whenever an API key header is missing. Our prompt includes all the relevant pieces: context about the Node app, the role as a *senior backend engineer*, the input code snippet, the steps we want for debugging, and the ultimate purpose—fixing those errors.  

When Gemini sees this, it understands the context, the debugging tasks, and the desired outcome. It can then give us a concise or detailed plan to refactor or fix our middleware to properly return 401, rather than a 500 error.”

---

### **Slide 6: Everyday Scenario (RTF)**
- **Slide Content**: The RTF-based prompt for drafting an apology email.

“Here’s a simple everyday-life scenario. We need to write a quick apology email for a delayed meeting. We use **RTF**—role, task, format. We assign the role of *polite personal assistant*, specify the task—draft an apology email—and define the format—a short, formal paragraph.  

Gemini (or any LLM) takes these instructions and returns a neatly written paragraph. No overcomplicating with steps or context—it’s a straightforward approach, perfect for small, quick tasks.”

### **Slide 7: Key Takeaways**
- **Slide Content**: Four bullet points highlighting the importance of prompt engineering and frameworks.

“At this point, let’s recap the **key takeaways**:

1. Prompt engineering is about guiding AI models for **better, more relevant answers**.  
2. Frameworks like CRISP, RTF, SCQA, and others help ensure **clarity and consistency**.  
3. These frameworks are **model-agnostic**—they work with Gemini, GPT, Llama, or any LLM.  
4. **Pick a framework** based on the complexity and context of your task. For short tasks, keep it simple; for complex tasks, provide more detail.”

### **Slide 8: Next Steps**
- **Slide Content**: Encourages further experimentation with frameworks, references the Gemini cookbook, and suggests iterative refinement.

“So, where do we go from here?

- **Explore** more frameworks: experiment with SCQA, PEEL, or RASCEF.  
- Check out the [Gemini Cookbook](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook) for more advanced examples and best practices.  
- **Iterate and refine**—the more you experiment, the better you’ll understand how to structure prompts for the best results.  

Thank you for joining this quick tour of **Prompt Engineering** and **Frameworks**. I hope you found this introduction helpful, and I encourage you to try out these frameworks in your own projects!”
