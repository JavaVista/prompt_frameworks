    "\n",
    "**Prompt engineering** is all about crafting the right instructions for large language models (LLMs). By providing the appropriate context, format, style, or audience details, you help the AI produce more accurate and relevant answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use Prompt Frameworks?**\n",
    "- They provide **clarity**—ensuring you specify crucial information up front.\n",
    "- They keep prompts **consistent**—useful for repeated tasks or multiple requests.\n",
    "- They reduce **ambiguity**—leading to fewer misinterpretations, fewer hallucinations, and better AI outputs.\n",
    "- They can contribute to saving money on tokens, which may reduce both costs and valuable time."

       "\n",
       "**Phase 1: Design & Prototyping (1 week)**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Wireframing:**  Create low-fidelity wireframes outlining page layout and functionality (profile picture, bio, activity feed, social media links).  Prioritize clear navigation and accessibility.  (Reference: App design guidelines)\n",
       "* **UI Design:**  Develop high-fidelity mockups based on wireframes, adhering to existing style guide.  Focus on intuitive user experience and visual consistency. (Reference: App style guide)\n",
       "* **Prototype:** Create an interactive prototype for user testing.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Phase 2: Development (2 weeks)**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Backend:**  Develop API endpoints for profile data management (CRUD operations) and social media integration (OAuth 2.0 for secure authorization).  Implement robust error handling and data validation.\n",
       "* **Frontend:**  Develop the user interface based on approved designs. Implement secure data handling and storage, following security best practices (e.g., encryption, input sanitization).\n",
       "* **Social Media Integration:**  Implement OAuth 2.0 flows for Facebook, Twitter (and other planned platforms). Handle potential errors gracefully.\n",
       "* **Unit & Integration Testing:**  Thorough testing of all components to ensure functionality and stability.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Phase 3: Testing & Refinement (1 week)**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Usability Testing:** Conduct user testing on the prototype and final product to identify areas for improvement.  Gather feedback on UX and UI.\n",
       "* **Security Testing:** Perform security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n",
       "* **Bug Fixing:** Address any identified bugs based on testing feedback.\n",
       "* **Iterative Design:** Refine the design and functionality based on testing results and stakeholder feedback.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Phase 4: Deployment (1 week)**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Deployment to Staging:** Deploy to staging environment for final testing and quality assurance.\n",
       "* **Release to Production:** Deploy to production environment after successful staging testing.\n",
       "* **Monitoring:** Monitor app performance and user feedback post-launch.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Considerations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Security:**  Prioritize secure handling of user data and social media credentials.  Employ secure coding practices and regular security audits.\n",
       "* **Privacy:**  Ensure compliance with relevant privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).  Clearly communicate data usage practices to users.\n",
       "* **Accessibility:**  Design the profile page to be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Iteration Plan:** Stakeholder feedback will be incorporated after each phase, potentially requiring adjustments to timelines and deliverables.  A post-launch review will inform future iterations and improvements.\n"
