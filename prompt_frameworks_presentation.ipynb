    "### **Why Use Prompt Frameworks?**\n",
    "- They provide **clarity**—ensuring you specify crucial information up front.\n",
    "- They keep prompts **consistent**—useful for repeated tasks or multiple requests.\n",
    "- They reduce **ambiguity**—leading to fewer misinterpretations and better AI outputs."

       "2. **Simplify:** Temporarily comment out all routes and middleware *after* the provided snippet to isolate the problem. If 500 errors persist, the issue lies within the middleware itself (unlikely given the code). Otherwise, the problem is in subsequent code.\n",

       "Code Fix (if problem isn't in subsequent code):  The provided middleware is correctly handling the missing API key.  The 500 errors are elsewhere.  No code changes are needed to this snippet *unless* step 2 reveals a problem *within* this middleware (highly unlikely given the simple nature of the code).  The solution will involve debugging the routes and other middleware that follow this one.\n",
